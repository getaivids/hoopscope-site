# Hoopscope Website v1 Changelog / Improvement Report

## Overview
This release implements a complete code and content review for the Hoopscope basketball analytics web platform, with the following main objectives:
- Debug/Fix prior code issues
- Replace Gemini API with OpenAI API (secure key-handling)
- Optimize for performance, accessibility, SEO
- Improve and add suggestions to blog content
- Systematize versioning in Google Drive and GitHub

## Major Changes

### Code & UX
- Fixed accessibility issues (semantic roles/labels, better keyboard navigation on blog buttons, alt text improvements).
- Enhanced responsive design in all sections, especially cards and hero block.
- **Performance:**
  - Images now load lazily (`loading="lazy"`).
  - IntersectionObserver for smooth animations, not scroll event.
- **AI Integration:**
  - All AI calls now use a secure OpenAI endpoint via `/api/openai-completions`. No API keys in client.
  - Error handling for AI calls improved (status, invalid responses, user feedback on failure).
  - Prompt engineering specific to basketball analytics for blogs and workout plans.

### Blog Content Management
- Blog data array cleaned (HTML removed from snippets, only summary).

- Blog AI tools suggest engagement/follow-up questions.
- Guidance for metadata/SEO added in README.

### SEO/Metadata

- Changelog and README included in root of each version.
